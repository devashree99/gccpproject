      <h2> CROISSANTS</h2>
      <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl
        but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1] Croissants are named for their historical crescent
        shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a
        thin
        sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff
        pastry.

        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since
        antiquity[2] but using brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and
        pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the
        brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.[3] In the late 1970s, the development of
        factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by
        unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to
        American-style fast food,[4] and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and
        patisseries
        were baked from frozen dough.

      <h2 align="right">MACRAONS</h2>
      <p>A macaron (/ˌmækəˈrɒn/ MAK-ə-RON,[1][2] French: [makaʁɔ̃] (listen)) or French macaroon (/ˌmækəˈruːn/
        MAK-ə-ROON)[3][4] is a sweet meringue-based confection made with egg white, icing sugar, granulated sugar,
        almond meal, and food coloring, akin to a sandwich cookie.The macaron is traditionally held to have been
        introduced in France by the Italian chef of queen Catherine de Medici during the Renaissance. Since the 19th
        century, a typical Parisian-style macaron is presented with a ganache, buttercream or jam filling sandwiched
        between two such cookies. The confection is characterized by a smooth squared top, a ruffled
        circumference—referred to as the "crown" or "foot" (or "pied")—and a flat base.
        Itis mildly moist and easily melts in the mouth. Macarons can be found in a wide variety of flavors that range
        from the traditional (raspberry, chocolate) to unusual (foie gras, matcha)

      <h2>TART</h2>
      <p>A tart is a baked dish consisting of a filling over a pastry base with an open top not covered with pastry.
        The pastry is usually shortcrust pastry; the filling may be sweet or savoury, though modern tarts are usually
        fruit-based, sometimes with custard. Tartlet refers to a miniature tart; an example would be egg tarts. The
        categories of "tart", "flan", "quiche", and "pie" overlap, with no sharp distinctions.

        The French word tarte can be translated to mean either pie or tart, as both are mainly the same with the
        exception of a pie usually covering the filling in pastry, while flans and tarts leave it open.[1]

        Tarts are thought to have either come from a tradition of layering food, or to be a product of Medieval pie
        making. Enriched dough (i.e. short crust) is thought to have been first commonly used in 1550, approximately
        200
        years after pies. In this period, they were viewed as high-cuisine, popular with nobility, in contrast to the
        view of a commoners pie. While originally savoury, with meat fillings, culinary tastes led to sweet tarts to
        prevail, filling tarts instead with fruit and custard.[2] Early medieval tarts generally had meat fillings,
        but
        later ones were often based on fruit and custard.[3]

        An early tart was the Italian crostata, dating to at least the mid-15th century. It has been described as a
        "rustic free-form version of an open fruit tart".
